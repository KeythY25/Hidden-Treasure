# Hidden-Treasure
 2D simulation game where players navigate a grid map to locate hidden treasure using artificial intelligence search algorithms

This repository contains the implementation of Hidden Treasure Hunt AI, a 2D simulation game that leverages artificial intelligence (AI) search algorithms to guide players in locating hidden treasure on a grid-based map. The project showcases the practical use of BFS (Breadth-First Search), A* (A-Star) Algorithm, and Hill Climbing techniques for efficient pathfinding and decision-making.
 
# Features

Dynamic Gameplay: Randomized grid initialization, starting point, and treasure location.
AI Search Algorithms:
BFS: Systematic exploration for uncovering clues.
A*: Optimized pathfinding using heuristics.
Hill Climbing: Efficient fine-tuning when close to the treasure.
Obstacle Navigation: Avoid static obstacles while exploring the map.
Energy Management: Players must reach the treasure before running out of energy.
